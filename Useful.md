### Difference Between `min sdk version`, `target sdk version` and `compile sdk version`

The `min sdk version` is the minimum version of the Android operating system required to run your application.

The `target sdk version` is the version of Android that your app was created to run on.

The `compile sdk version` is the the version of Android that the build tools uses to compile and build the application in order to release, run, or debug.

*Usually the compile sdk version and the target sdk version are the same.*
